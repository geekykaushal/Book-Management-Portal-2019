# Book-Management-Portal-2019
This is purely based on Book management diary which used to stored the name, author ,and ISBN number of the book in the local storage of the Browser. I used many languages for the implementation and hope you would like as well. I used HTML, JavaScript and Bootstrap for the implementation, in addition i used Sweetaleart library for the attractive features.
